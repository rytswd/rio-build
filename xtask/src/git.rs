/// The hash is `sha256(git diff HEAD)` — content-addressed, so
/// identical dirty state → identical tag (recomputable across
/// invocations / worktrees), and editing a file's CONTENT changes the
/// tag even when the set of changed paths stays the same. The previous
/// path-list hash gave the same tag for two different edits to the
/// same file → second `--push` was a no-op against immutable ECR tags
/// and silently kept stale image content.
///
/// Scope matches what `nix build` sees from the git fileset:
/// `git diff HEAD` covers staged + unstaged changes to tracked files
/// (including staged new files); untracked-unstaged files are excluded
/// here AND invisible to the nix build, so they correctly don't affect
/// the tag. Binary files are covered by the `index <old>..<new>` blob-
/// SHA line in the diff header even without `--binary`.
///
/// Process-cached: `up` runs Push and Ami concurrently, then Deploy.
/// Recomputing in Deploy after Ami (or a parallel editor) touched the
/// tree would yield a different tag than Push used → `assert_in_ecr`
/// rejects the tag Push just uploaded. First call wins; all phases in
/// one `xtask` invocation see the same value.
