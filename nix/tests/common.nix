  # Order matters: groups run in list order. Put state-sensitive groups
  # (e.g. cli's `builds` empty-state assertion) BEFORE groups that

  # side-effects (TriggerGC) LAST.
  #
  # Indent caveat: a body line that is the col-0 sentinel of a Python
  # heredoc / triple-quoted string would shift under the 4-space prefix
  # and change the string content. None today (every shell heredoc is

  # ── Build helper v2 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
  #
  # Scenario build() helper. Supersedes the v1 helper which baked
  # drv_file at Nix-eval time (one drv per test). Scenarios need
  # multiple drvs per test, so drv_file is a PYTHON-runtime param now.
  #
  # Nix-eval config (varies by fixture, not by call):
  #   gatewayHost  — default ssh-ng://<this> store URL
  #   dumpLogsExpr — Python expression called in the except: arm
  #                  (differs for k3s-full vs standalone — see usage)
  #
  # Python-runtime params (vary per call):
  #   drv_file       — path to .nix file (or .drv)
  #   attr           — -A attribute name (default: build the file's
  #                    top-level expr; "" = no -A flag)
  #   extra_args     — arbitrary --arg/--argstr for FOD scenarios
  #   capture_stderr — 2>&1 (default True; False for stderr-separate
  #                    tests asserting on the clean stdout path)
  #   expect_fail    — use client.fail instead of client.succeed
  #   timeout_wrap   — `timeout N` outer shell wrapper for a regression
  #                    hard bound on the spawned nix-build
  #   store_url      — override --store (default ssh-ng://${gatewayHost});
  #                    tenant/identity-file cases pass a different URL.
  #                    Folds in security.nix build_drv (identity_file →
  #                    ?ssh-key= querystring) AND lifecycle tenant-alias
  #                    builds. What was 3 outliers is now 1 param.
  #   strip_to_store_path — return last non-empty line (skips SSH
  #                    known_hosts warning + build progress under
  #                    2>&1); default True when capture_stderr=True.
  #                    Absorbs the inline last-line-extract that
  #                    security.nix + lifecycle.nix both did.
  #
  # Usage (k3s-full):
  #   ''${common.mkBuildHelperV2 {
  #     gatewayHost  = "k3s-server";
  #     dumpLogsExpr = ''dump_all_logs([], kube_node=k3s_server, kube_namespace="''${ns}")'';

  #     dumpLogsExpr = "dump_all_logs([''${gatewayHost}] + all_workers)";

  # /var/lib/rio/cov, and copies to $out/coverage/<node>/.

  # Stop ORDER matters: workers first. (Stream-era rationale, kept:
  # a dead worker closed the removed BuildExecution bidi stream so
  # the scheduler held no open response streams at SIGTERM. With
  # pull-mode unaries there are no server streams at all; stopping
  # workers first still lets their bounded ReportOutcome attempts
  # finish before the scheduler's serve_with_shutdown returns.)
